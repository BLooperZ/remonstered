# DOTT reMONSTERed

Builds sound resource for [ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org/) using High-Quality SFX and Speech from [DOTT Remastered](http://dott.doublefine.com/).

## Download
You can find a ready-to-use build in the [Releases page](https://github.com/BLooperZ/remonstered/releases).
(Built with PyInstaller)

## Install
1.  Extract the following files from `tenta.cle`:
    * `iMUSEClient_SFX.fsb`
    * `iMUSEClient_VO.fsb` 

    Can be done using [DoubleFine Explorer](https://quickandeasysoftware.net/software/doublefine-explorer)

    ... You can also use it to extract the classic game, to play it using ScummVM.

2.  Put the extracted file in the same directory with the script.

3.  Launch the script (or double click `remonster.exe`)

    This will create a file called `monster.so3` in same directory.

4.  Put `monster.so3` in same directory with the classic game.

    Make sure there are no other `monster` files (`sou`, `sog` or `sof`) there.
